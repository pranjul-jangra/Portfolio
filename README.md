#Personal Portfolio

#It's my personal portfolio build with,
1. Basic frontend stacks (HTML, CSS and JavaScript).
2. TailwindCSS providing utility-first CSS classes to build interfaces quickly and efficiently.
3. GreenSock Animation Platform for creating smooth, complex, and highly interactive animations.
4. Vite for faster developement with HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and for smaller final bundle size.

It's built in a manner that it automatically switches between the light mode and dark mode based on your device theme so you don't need to manualy switch the theme.
